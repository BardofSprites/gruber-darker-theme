* Installation

** Manual old fashioned way
Download the theme to your local directory. You can do it through ~git clone~ command:

#+begin_src shell
git clone git://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme.git
#+end_src

Then add path to gruber-darker-theme to custom-theme-load-path list â€” add the following to your emacs config file somewhere (.emacs, init.el, whatever):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
             "/path/to/gruber-darker-theme/")
#+end_src

Use ~M-x customize-themes~ to change your current theme.
